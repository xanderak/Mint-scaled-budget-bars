# Mint-scaled-progress-bars
In the Budgets screen on Mint, this scales the bars relative to the size of the budget and the amount spent.
$1000 over is obviously more noticeable than $5 over.

## New colors
Gray | how much you have spent.
Green | how much budget you have LEFT
Red | how much has been OVER spent.

I hope you find this useful!  Comments welcome!

This works currently as of April 2017.  If Mint has updated their code/classes/bars since then, then this may well stop working.
