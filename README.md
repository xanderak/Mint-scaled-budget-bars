# Mint-scaled-progress-bars
In the Budgets screen on Mint, this scales the bars relative to the size of the budget and the amount spent.

$1000 over is obviously more noticeable than $5 over.

Gray now means how much you have spent.

Green means how much budget you have LEFT

Red now means how much has been OVER spent.

I hope this is useful for some of you!  Enjoy!

This works currently as of April 2017.  If Mint updates their code/classes/bars, then this will likely stop working.
