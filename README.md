# Mint Scaled Budget Bars
In the Budgets screen on Mint, this scales the bars relative to the size of the budget and the amount spent.
$1000 over is obviously more noticeable than $5 over, and you can tell very quickly if you are overspent!

## Installation instructions

1. If you use Chrome, download the [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) extension.
2. On other browsers, use the [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) extension.
3. Once installed, click on **[this link](https://github.com/xanderak/Mint-scaled-budget-bars/raw/master/budget_bars.user.js)**, and choose **Install**.
4. Go to [mint.com](http://mint.com/), log in, and go to Budgets screen.

## New colors
- **Gray** is how much you have spent.
- **Green** is how much budget you have **left**.
- **Red** is how much has been **overspent**.

## Notes

I hope you find this useful!  Comments welcome!

This works currently as of April 2017.  If Mint has updated their code/classes/bars since then, then this may well stop working.
